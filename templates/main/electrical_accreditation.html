        <p class="lead">Electrical accreditation is a legal requirement in France for anyone working on or near electrical installations. This certification ensures that employees are aware of electrical hazards, understand the risks, and know how to protect themselves and others. The training is based on the French standard NFC 18-510 and is mandatory for both electricians and non-electricians performing electrical work.</p>

                <h2>About Electrical Accreditation</h2>
                <p>
                    In France, electrical accreditation is required by law for all professionals who carry out operations (works, repairs, interventions) on industrial or domestic electrical installations. The NFC 18-510 standard defines the obligations for employers and employees regarding electrical safety. At the end of the training, a certificate is delivered, allowing the employer to validate the electrical accreditation titles for their staff.
